**Description:** We want to create a Chrome extension to make the class registration process on MyCuInfo easier and faster for the students. To do this, it should pull class data from the user’s degree audit, the CU course catalog, and MyCUInfo itself, and overlay information relevant to the user onto the course registration platform. Features might include showing class conflicts in the “shopping cart” phase of registration, showing required prerequisites for potential classes, and a “what if” calendar that displays a visual schedule of potential classes. Advanced features might include a personalized display of coursed based on degree requirements, a tree of prerequisite classes, and a fully integrated user interface.

**Vision statement:** A world where signing up for classes is user friendly.

**Motivation:** Registering for classes at CU Boulder has always been cumbersome and irritating. An extension that makes this process more intuitive and easy to complete would be beneficial for us and our classmates

**Risks:** 
* No experience making chrome extensions
* Little experience with HTML parsing
* No prior experience working with the people on the team
* Lack of backend access (no access to database information)
* One task taking a lot longer than expected

**Mitigation strategies:**
* Learning how to make chrome extensions through online tutorials and Google’s documentation
* Working with the team
* Just don’t work with the backend portions
