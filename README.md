**Vision statement:** A world where signing up for classes is user friendly.

**Motivation:** Registering for classes at CU Boulder has always been cumbersome and irritating. An extension that makes this process more intuitive and easy to complete would be beneficial for us and our classmates

**Description:** We created a Chrome extension to make the class registration process on MyCUInfo easier and faster for students to use. The current system makes planning a schedule extremely difficult. This is due mainly to the inability to visualize a schedule until after completing registration and lack of course and prerequisite availability on the registration page. ClassyBuffs is a Chrome extension which creates a "What if?" calendar from all the classes in a user's shopping cart, overlaid on the classes for which they are currently enrolled fully integrated into the registration page. Conflicts show up red on the schedule, and conflicting classes can be toggled with the click of a button. Course catalog information is added to the shopping cart, and prerequisite information is available in the hovertext of each class. With ClassyBuffs, users can confidently build a great class schedule without leaving the registration page.

To use, simply download the code from our repo, and follow the steps outlined here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked
