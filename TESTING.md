### Vision statement: 
* A world where signing up for classes is user friendly.

### Automated Test Cases:
* We used the testing tool **Mocha** to test some of our extension functionality.
* Mocha can be found at [this link](https://mochajs.org/)
#### Test 1: getDep
* The getDepartment function parses html elements on the myCUinfo registration page.
* The test verifies that it is parsing the course departments correctly so that they match keys in our course dictionaries.
#### Test 2: getNum
* The getCourse function parses html elements on the myCUinfo registration page.
* This test verifies that the function is parsing the course numbers correctly so that we can perform dictionary look-ups correctly
#### Test 3: showPreReq
* The getPreReqs uses course information gained from our parsing of HTML elements to find the pre-requisites for specific courses.
* This test verifies that the function navigates our course dictionary correctly
